# StatnMap Hugo theme

StatnMap theme is issued from [hugo-icarus-theme by
digitalcraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-icarus-theme),
but I thought visual changes were to big to keep it as a fork. This is a
responsive and customizable theme for bloggers and freelancers. It’s
originally a port of the Icarus theme for [Hexo](//hexo.io) made by
[Ruipeng Zhang](https://github.com/ppoffice). The theme has been
revamped to look like wordpress twenty-fifteen theme.  
Noteworthy features of this Hugo theme are the integration of a
comment-system powered by **Utterances**, **multilingual** support and
**language switch**, **syntax highlighting** and **code folding** for
source code, **how-to-cite card** and **related articles** sections on
bottom of articles, **contact form** and optional widgets for the
sidebar.

## Get the theme

I assume you’ve Git installed. Inside the folder of your Hugo site run

    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/statnmap/hugo-statnmap-theme.git

You should see a folder called `hugo-statnmap-theme` inside the `themes`
directory that we created a few moments ago. For more information read
the official [setup guide](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of
Hugo.

## Setup

Next, navigate to the `exampleSite` folder at
`themes/hugo-type-theme/exampleSite/`. In order to get your site
running, you need to copy `config.toml` and all the content of all
relevant subfolders such as `i18n/en.toml` into the root folders.

To turn the `exampleSite` folder in a standalone demo site the
`themesDir` property has been set to `../..`. This way you can preview
this theme by running `hugo server` inside `exampleSite` folder.

**Due to the customized `themesDir` path Hugo will fail to find themes
if you copied the `config.toml` into the root directory of a regular
Hugo website.** Make sure you comment out the `themesDir` property if
you use the theme in production.

## The config file

Now, let us take a look into the `config.toml`. Feel free to play around
with the settings.

### Comments

The optional comment system is powered by Utterances. Enter the GitHub repository `"handle/repo"` where comments will be synced.

    utteranceGitHubRepo = ""

Tip: you can disable the comment section for a single page in its
frontmatter:

``` toml
+++
disable_comments = true
+++
```

### Menu

You can also define the items menu entries as you like. First, let us
link a post that you’ve written. We can do this in the frontmatter of
the post’s content file by setting `menu` to `main`.

    +++
    menu = "main"
    +++

Furthermore, we can add entries that don’t link to posts. Back in the
`config.toml` you’ll find a section for the menus:

    [[params.menu]]
        before = true
        label  = "Home"
        link   = "/"

Define a label and enter the URL to resource you want to link. With
`before` you can decide whether the link should appear before **or**
after all linked posts in the menu. Therefore, `Home` appears before the
linked post.

### Sidebars

In order to use the full width of the website you can disable the
profile on the left and / or the widgets on the right for a single page
in the frontmatter:

``` toml
+++
disable_profile = true
disable_widgets = true
+++
```

### Tell me who you are

This theme also provides a profile section on the left. Add your social
network accounts to the profile section on the left by entering your
username under `params.social`. The links to your account will be created
automatically.

### Widgets

Beside the profile section you can add widgets on the right sidebar. The
following widgets are available:

-   recent articles
-   category list
-   tag list
-   tag cloud

You can deactivate them under `params.widgets`:

    [params.widgets]
        recent_articles = false
        categories = true
        tags = true
        tag_cloud = true

### Date line

The date line includes: post date, \# of words, approximate reading,
time tags and categories. However, if you want certain pages to omit the
date line, simply put `nodateline = true` in the front matter for that
page.

### Disable Previous / next article links

To disable the inclusion of a previous/next article link at the bottom
of the page, add `noprevnext = true` to the front matter. This feature,
along with `nodateline` can be used to create standalone pages that are
less “blog-like”

## Multilingual

You don’t blog in English and you want to translate the theme into
different language? No problem. Take a look in the `i18n` folder and
you’ll find a file `en.toml`. It contains all strings related to the
theme. Copy this file, change the name so that it reflects the
translation language (like `fr.toml`) and modify the strings needed.

A language switcher is also available with multilingual website
activated. You can add png images of flags named ‘lang.png’ in
‘static/flags’ folder, for new languages other than English and French.

The `config.toml` file in `exampleSite` proposes menus for a second
language (French). However, as no posts, itemized or contacts are saved
with `.fr.md` extension in this exampleSite, menu items may redirect to
the `404 not found` page.

If you only have one language for your website, you can remove every
`Languages`, `Languages.en` and `Languages.fr` occurrences. Simple
`[menu.main]` have to be used instead.

## Contact form

Since this page will be static, you can use formspree.io as proxy to
send the actual email. Each month, visitors can send you up to one
thousand emails without incurring extra charges. Begin the setup by
following the steps below:

1.  Enter your email address under ‘emailservice’ in contact/index.md
    file
2.  Upload the generated site to your server
3.  Send a dummy email yourself to confirm your account
4.  Click the confirm link in the email from formspree.io
5.  You’re done. Happy mailing!

## Linking thumbnails

After creating a new post you can define a banner by entering the
relative path to the image.

    banner = "banners/placeholder.png"

Credit: [digitalcraftsman](//github.com/digitalcraftsman)

A thumbnail will be used for the recent\_articles list in the sidebar as
well as in the normal list of articles. If you want a specific thumbnail
instead of the banner croped, you can define it by entering the relative
path to the thumbnail.

    thumbnail = "banners/thumbnail.png"

This way you can store them either next to the content file or in the
`static` folder.

## Mathematical equations

Mathematical equations in form of LaTeX or MathML code can be rendered
with the support of [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org). MathML works out
of the box. If you’re using LaTeX you need to wrap your equation with
`$$`.

You can also print formulas inline. In this case wrap the formula only
once with `$`.

If you don’t need equations, you can disable MathJax but putting
`disable_mathjax = true` in your config.toml. This will prevent clients
from unnecessarily downloading the MathJax library.

MathJax CDN and versions can be modified in the `config.toml` file:

    MathJaxCDN = "//cdn.bootcss.com"
    MathJaxVersion = "2.7.1"

## Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting for code is allowed with `highlight.js`. This can be
disabled in the `config.toml`. Version, additional languages, CDN and
theme can also be modified.

    disable_highlight = false
    highlightjsVersion = "9.11.0"
    highlightjsCDN = "//cdn.bootcss.com"
    highlightjsLang = ["r", "yaml"]
    highlightjsTheme = "github"

## Code folding

Code folding is enabled by default with `disable_codefolding = false` in
parameters of the `config` file. It uses somes javascript libraries of
[bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/javascript/). Code folding
(multilingual) buttons only appear when there is code in the document
rendered from `Rmd` in blogdown. `disable_codefolding` can also be used
in each article config header. Similarly, you can define if code blocks
are shown or hidden by default using `codefolding_show = "hide"` in the
config file or in each article config.  
The list of `<pre>` blocks on which to apply code folding is defined in
the `config` file:
`codeblocks = ["pre.sourceCode", "pre.r", "pre.python"]`

## Sticky list pages

A special kind of posts list is implemented. This allows to show the
first article completely and the other articles as a list with
summaries. For that, we use the implemented template
`list_first_plain_sticky.html` in `partial`. You can use it in two ways:

1.  With Taxonomy This is implemented in the `exampleSite`.

    -   Create a new taxonomy like ‘sticky’:

    <!-- -->

        [Taxonomies]
          tag = "tags"
          category = "categories"
          sticky = "stickies"

    -   Create a folder `layout` &gt; `taxonomy`
    -   Create a html file named `sticky.html` with this code:

    <!-- -->

        {{ define "main" }}
          {{ if isset .Site.Taxonomies "sticky" }}
            {{ partial "list_first_plain_sticky" . }}
          {{ end }}
        {{ end }}

    -   Add taxonomy `stickies` in a post or a page. The newest page or
        the page with `weight = 1` will be shown entirely before the
        other of the same taxonomy (that will only show a summary). In
        the exampleSite, pages in `sticky_pages` have this taxonomy.

2.  With special pages

    -   Create a folder `layout` &gt; `sticky_pages` for instance
    -   Create a html file named `list.html` with this code:

    <!-- -->

        {{ define "main" }}
            {{ partial "list_first_plain_sticky" . }}
        {{ end }}

    -   Create a folder `content` &gt; `sticky_pages` (This is done in
        the `exampleSite`)
    -   Add a page. The newest page or the page with `weight = 1` will
        be shown entirely before the other of the same taxonomy (that
        will only show a summary)

## Citation

As for [Radix](https://rstudio.github.io/radix/), a citation field can
be added to blog posts. Citation is enabled by default with
`disable_citation = false` in parameters of the `config` file. It can
also be enabled or disabled in each blog post with `disable_citation` in
the post YAML / TOML. By default author comes from blog `author` field
in the article header but `citation_author` overrides this field if
another writing is needed. `citation_author` can be specified globally
in `config` file but also for each blog post.

## Gallery shortcode

This shortcode you to easily include a gallery into your pages. Copy the
code below into your content file and enter the relative paths to your
images.

    {{< gallery
        "/banners/placeholder.png"
        "/banners/placeholder.png"
        "/banners/placeholder.png"
    >}}

## Related articles

You can define parameters for related articles at the bottom of blog
posts.

    [related]
      # Only include matches with rank >= threshold. This is a normalized rank between 0 and 100.
      threshold = 50
      # To get stable "See also" sections we, by default, exclude newer related pages.
      includeNewer = true
      # Will lower case keywords in both queries and in the indexes.
      toLower = true
    [[related.indices]]
    name = "keywords"
    weight = 150
    [[related.indices]]
    name  = "author"
    toLower = true
    weight = 30
    [[related.indices]]
    name  = "tags"
    weight = 100
    [[related.indices]]
    name  = "date"
    weight = 10
    pattern = "2006"
